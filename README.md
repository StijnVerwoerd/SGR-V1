# SGR-V1.0
### A fully custom implementation of the 32-bit RISC-V ISA. From logic design to physical hardware.

## About

Welcome to the SGR-V project! Our goal is to design and build a fully functional 32-bit RISC-V computer from the ground up. This includes creating the logic design, circuitry, and ultimately the physical hardware. Our computer aims to support a rudimentary operating system with the following features:

* **VGA Display:** Output graphical content to a standard VGA monitor.
* **USB Input:** Support for USB peripherals such as keyboards and mice.
* **Gaming:** Play simple games designed for our hardware.
* **Text Editor:** A basic text editor for writing and editing documents.
* **File Management** A file management program for organizing and handling files.
* **Additional Features:** Other functionalities typical of similar machines.
